				a(href='http://maquinalectora.net/tag/artificial-intelligence/') It sounded so weird and so unbelievable that I wasn’t sure if this was a serious work from an accomplished academic, as Dr Robin Hanson, or a science fiction dystopia. Perhaps, it’s both.

				a(href='//metaxisreviews.com/home/2017/2/4/agge-of-em-where-sci-fi-meets-economics') Simultaneously an economic treatise and a work of deep speculative fiction, it’s a melding of genre rarely seen, but dearly welcome. … Hanson, simply, is willing to take chances, make big assumptions, and see where the cards fall. It’s a style of romantic academic endeavor long out of favor.

				a(href='//hanson.gmu.edu/interzone2017.html') struggles without merit to deny obviously science fictional content, if not its groundbreaking approach to genre concerns of identity, immortality, and virtuality. Although as nonfiction it is cursed by a somewhat unreliable narrator, the assured depth of its varied speculative aspects - taking in post-scarcity economics, social philosophy, and political futurism - makes this contribution to genre scholarship an invaluable guide for fellow travelers on the roads to quasi-utopian states.

				a(href='//diplomaticourier.com/age-em-work-love-life-robots-rule-earth-robin-hanson') The depth and breadth of his analysis is undeniable. In reading the work one is simply stunned at the sheer volume of thought into em existence Hanson provides–short of perhaps interior decorating (and even then he notes the possibilities are limitless), one is hard pressed to find an area Hanson left uncovered. Readers of Age of Em will find it weighty and be left wishing that Hanson crafted an overarching narrative that puts his richly envisioned world into context.

				a(href='//singularityweblog.com/age-of-em') The Age of Em by Robin Hanson is the best worst book I have read in a very long while. It is the best because Robin has a very effective, efficient and eloquent writing style and a personality to match it. … It is the worst because The Age of Em is an efficiency utopia: a place where … one person one vote doesn’t work [does it ever?], ems live to work and not the other way around … and humanity has either starved to extinction or has become a tool of our tools.')
