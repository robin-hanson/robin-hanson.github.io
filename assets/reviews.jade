				a(href='//slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/28/book-review-age-of-em') I can’t think of another book of this depth and quality in the same niche. .. I highly recommend Age of Em as a fantastically fun read and a great introduction to these concepts. It’s engaging, readable, and weird. I just don’t know if it’s weird enough.
