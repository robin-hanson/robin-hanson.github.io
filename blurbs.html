The Age of Em is a stimulating and unique book that will be valuable to anyone who wants to look past the next ten years to the next hundred and the next thousand.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Sean Carroll</div><div class="desc">Professor of Physics, California Institute of Technology, author of <cite>The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>What happens when a first-rate economist applies his rigor, breadth, and curiosity to the sci-fi topic of whole brain emulations?

They'll make alliances, compete, cooperate… and very-likely love… all driven by immutable laws of nature and economics. Super intelligence may be a lot more like us than you imagined.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">David Brin</div><div class="desc">two times Hugo award winner, author of <cite>Existence and The Transparent Society</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>Robin Hanson provides a richly detailed portrait of a future society where brain emulation is widespread.

In The Age of Em Robin Hanson explores one such possibility using methods and insight that all analysts of future technology can admire.

Now, in The Age of Em, he's produced the quintessential Hansonian book, one unlike any other that's ever been written. Hanson is emphatic that he hasn't optimized in any way for telling a good story, or for imparting moral lessons about the present: only for maximizing the probability that what he writes will be relevant to the actual future of our civilization. Early in the book, Hanson estimates that probability as 10%. His figure seems about right to me — and if you're able to understand why that's unbelievably high praise, then The Age of Em is for you.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Scott Aaronson</div><div class="desc">author of <cite>Quantum Computing since Democritus</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>Robin Hanson's new tour de force will dazzle and delight you.

The Age of Em combines Hanson’s expertise in social science and artificial intelligence to paint a stunning vision of the future of intelligent life. The result is a noble effort to subordinate science fiction to science.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Bryan Caplan</div><div class="desc">author of <cite>The Myth of the Rational Voter</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>Robin Hanson integrates ferocious future forces: robotics, artificial intelligence, overpopulation, economic stagnation — and comes up with a detailed, striking of futures we can have, if we think harder. There's many an idea in this deft book, worth the time of anyone who thinks forward with hope.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Gregory Benford</div><div class="desc">two-time Nebula award winner, author of <cite>Timescape</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>Robin Hanson is one of the most original thinkers in the world - and this fascinating account of our future society is like nothing you'll read anywhere else. Astonishing stuff.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Tim Harford</div><div class="desc">columnist at Financial Times, author of <cite>The Undercover Economist Strikes Back</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>Hanson is pioneering a new style of science fiction: using calculations rather than mere stories to imagine what a world of artificial humans would be like.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Kevin Kelly</div><div class="desc">author of <cite>The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>Age of Em is a rare wonder: a book both fully intellectually rigorous, and boldly embracing of the radical possibilities the future holds. Hanson focuses his acute analytical mind on future scenarios in which most humans are digital 'brain emulations' rather than biological humans. He shows that many aspects of this sort of world can be understood fairly effectively by us old-fashioned biological humans right now, using tools from economics, logic, psychology, sociology and other disciplines. The result is a tour de force at the intersection of imagination and rationality. Far more clearly than from any work of mere science fiction, one gleans from Hanson's book a clear idea of what a future world dominated by brain emulations or 'Ems' might actually be like.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Ben Goertzel</div><div class="desc">founder of AGI Society and OpenCog Foundation</div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>The Age of Em is a fascinating and provocative book about a future that will blindside most humans — but that could easily be the world that most of our descendants inhabit. Robin Hanson has a unique combination of expertise in artificial intelligence. economics, signaling, and futurology. Nobody else could have explored the implications of whole-brain emulation in such visionary yet plausible detail. It's one of the most important books you'll ever read.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Geoffrey Miller</div><div class="desc">author of <cite>The Mating Mind</cite>, <cite>Spent</cite>, <cite>Mate</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>Carefully reasoned, thoroughly researched, and incisively argued, this book will change the way you look at our uploaded future, and the entire concept of the Singularity.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Ramez Naam</div><div class="desc">author of <cite>Nexus and The Infinite Resource</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>Most futurism is remarkable chiefly for its lack of imagination.

Personally, I'd be shocked to see the future turn out this normal. But anyone who believes in standard economic theory and the computability of human intelligence would need to do a lot of fast talking to explain why the future wouldn't be at least this strange.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Eliezer Yudkowsky</div><div class="desc">author of <cite>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>Here we have a systematic attempt to envisage what could well be the next technological disruption of the human condition: a world after the ‘anthropocene’ which does not conform to the usual ecological scenarios. Drawing on current social and natural sciences, as well as artificial intelligence research, Robin Hanson envisages a future in which human beings are neither notably enhanced nor completely exterminated. Rather, we live in the margins of a world dominated by beings which will have been created from uploaded emulations of a selection of human brains. Hanson tackles all the issues that arise along the way: how the transition might happen and what will the world look like – both to us and to the ‘ems’ – on the other side of this great disruption. The reader does not need to agree with all the judgement calls in this expressly speculative enterprise to appreciate the great strides that Hanson has taken in specifying a world in which humans still flourish yet are no longer in the driver’s seat of epochal change. That his vision is ultimately a relatively benign one is an added bonus.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Steve Fuller</div><div class="desc">author of <cite>Humanity 2.0</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>Hanson takes a few simple assumptions and relentlessly follows their implications to paint a fascinating and chillingly plausible posthuman future, realised in fractal-like detail. A tour de force of rigorous speculation that draws equally upon physics, economics and neuroscience, every page of The Age of Em brims with fascinating ideas.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Hannu Rajaniemi</div><div class="desc">author of <cite>The Quantum Thief</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>The best way to predict the future may be to create it, but to create it you first must study it.

It is not too soon to think about this trend's logical conclusion: human brains directly emulated in computers. The Age of Em draws upon a vast array of knowledge from the natural and social sciences to paint an extremely detailed picture of the world of our silicon descendants, who will run at different clock speeds and copy themselves at will. ‘Ems’ will be cultural conservatives who barely make a living and use profanity. They will routinely mock us.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name">Michael Chwe</div><div class="desc">author of <cite>Jane Austen, Game Theorist</cite></div></div></div></section></main></body>
