Drawing on current social and natural sciences, as well as artificial intelligence research, Robin Hanson envisages a future in which human beings are neither notably enhanced nor completely exterminated. Rather, we live in the margins of a world dominated by beings which will have been created from uploaded emulations of a selection of human brains. Hanson tackles all the issues that arise along the way: how the transition might happen and what will the world look like – both to us and to the ‘ems’ – on the other side of this great disruption. The reader does not need to agree with all the judgement calls in this expressly speculative enterprise to appreciate the great strides that Hanson has taken in specifying a world in which humans still flourish yet are no longer in the driver’s seat of epochal change. That his vision is ultimately a relatively benign one is an added bonus.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name"><a href="//wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Fuller_(sociologist)">Steve Fuller</a></div><div class="desc">Auguste Comte Chair in Social Epistemology, University of Warwick, author of <cite>Humanity 2.0</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>Robin Hanson is the most brilliant mind I know, and the wait for his first book is finally over. <cite>The Age of Em</cite> combines Hanson’s expertise in social science and artificial intelligence to paint a stunning vision of the future of intelligent life.

Hanson focuses his acute analytical mind on future scenarios in which most humans are digital 'brain emulations' rather than biological humans. He shows that many aspects of this sort of world can be understood fairly effectively by us old-fashioned biological humans right now, using tools from economics, logic, psychology, sociology and other disciplines. The result is a tour de force at the intersection of imagination and rationality. Far more clearly than from any work of mere science fiction, one gleans from Hanson's book a clear idea of what a future world dominated by brain emulations or 'Ems' might actually be like.</blockquote><div class="who"><div class="name"><a href="//goertzel.org">Ben Goertzel</a></div><div class="desc">Chief Scientist at <cite>Aidyia Holdings</cite> and <cite>Hanson Robotics</cite>, founder of <cite>AGI Society</cite> and <cite>OpenCog Foundation</cite></div></div></div><div class="blurb"><blockquote>Robin Hanson is one of the most original thinkers in the world - and this fascinating account of our future society is like nothing you'll read anywhere else.

Now, in <cite>The Age of Em</cite>, he's produced the quintessential Hansonian book, one unlike any other that's ever been written. Hanson is emphatic that he hasn't optimized in any way for telling a good story, or for imparting moral lessons about the present: only for maximizing the probability that what he writes will be relevant to the actual future of our civilization. Early in the book, Hanson estimates that probability as 10%.
